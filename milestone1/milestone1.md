Origame :: Milestone 1
======================

User Research
-------------
1. **The Problem**
    Many city inhabitants, ranging from the freshly-unpacked to the life-long residents, have explored only a small fraction of what their city has to offer.
    #### The Solution
    Origami lets users unfold their city and discover the many gems hidden throughout its streets through indivudally tailored itineraries.

2. **Killer Features**
    + Makes planning a day out on the town very easy
    + Keeps track of where youâ€™ve been in order to suggest new places each time you go out
    + Takes into account environmental factors like weather and season as well as user specified limitations like time ranges or the presence of children
    + Gamified interaction keeps users engaged and promotes continued exploration of their cities
    + Takes advantage of HTML5 Javascript APIs like Media Capture and Geolocation to allow users to document their adventures


3. **Target Demographic**
    + Our target demographic will be residents who have been living in an area for less than five years. These residents are least likely to have explored the lesser-known offerings of a city.
    + We expect this New Residents group to consist of  a younger demographic - people who have not yet settled down. Thus, they will likely be tech savvy, own a smartphone, and be able to take advantage of mobile-specific bonus features.
