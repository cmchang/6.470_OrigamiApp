Questions
-------------
1. Quesiton number one (Team Members) from Milestone 1 has changed:
    * Benjamin Blair Chrobot, bchrobot@mit.edu, MIT, 6.2, 2015, undergraduate, competition only
    * Carolyn M Chang, changc@mit.edu, MIT, 6.3, 2016, undergraduate, registered
    * Kenneth Shaw Friedman, ksf@mit.edu, MIT, undeclared 2017, undergraduate, registered
2. We implemented hands-off day planning based on a few initial questions. The results aren't as tailored for the user as we would like yet.
3. We wanted to include gamificaiton in the MVP, but did not get to that.
4. We would still like to implement the following features:
    * Gameification - we have not yet started on this
    * Weather Awareness - we have not yet started on this
    * Mobile Javascript goodies - we have geolocation working on the map, although it's a little buggy
5. Meteor.js
6. Meteor.js, including Backbone, jQuery, Underscore, Handlebars, Leaflet, CloudMade, and Yelp API.
7. Chrome
8. We're still working on debugging occassional Meteor errors that we can't reliably reproduce. Working with 3rd party plugins that are not on Atmosphere yet has also been challenging.
